My setting:

First of all, I'm using [fisherman](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman) plugin manager. It creates symlinks for _all_ plugin functions in `~/.config/fish/functions/`, so it's rather inconvenient to store your own functions at the same place. This is why I moved my functions and the config out and installed it as a plugin:

- I create my functions in `~/dev/laughedelic/fish/functions/`
- I put my config (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`) as a snippet in `~/dev/laughedelic/fish/conf.d/` (see [this note](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman#1-what-is-the-required-fish-version))
- then just I install it with fisherman: `fisher install ~/dev/laughedelic/fish`
- every time I add new stuff, I do `fisher update ~/dev/laughedelic/fish` (or `fisher rm` + `fisher install`)

Then I just made this plugin a Git(hub) repo. Local plugins are treated a bit [differently](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman/issues/242) in fisherman, so I try to have one local plugin (this one).

It's quite convenient way of managing custom fish configuration, because it allows you to have your own things separate from the fish/fisherman autogenerated stuff and never touch `~/.config/fish/` again :ok_hand:
